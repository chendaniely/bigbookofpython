Having said that, I would strongly recommend that you install the tools and libraries described in the guides below before you start building Python applications for real-world use. In particular, you should always install Setuptools, Pip, and Virtualenv — they make it much easier for you to use other third-party Python libraries.\nhttps://docs.python-guide.org/starting/installation/"
