# Preface {.unnumbered}

This project is heavily inspired by the
[Big Book of R](https://www.bigbookofr.com/).
Here you will find a collection of (mostly free) Python learning resources.

This is a book created from markdown and executable code using
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/).
See @knuth84 for additional discussion of literate programming.
